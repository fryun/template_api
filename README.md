# template_api

This is a project template that I typically use for all API-based projects that use FastAPI. It is designed to expedite the process of creating a new project by allowing you to focus directly on the use case to be developed. The template already includes general error handling, a variety of sample errors and custom errors, routing, and API specifications to make Swagger more informative. The template also includes a simple Dockerfile for deploying with Docker and using Gunicron as an HTTP server.
